They finished last year with a respectable 76-86 which is very good for an expansion club.  Next season should prove to be a very interesting with a very telented group of player returning for an even improved campaign.  Rookie <em>Todd Martin</em> is expecting to continue his success and improve on his team leading 25 home runs from the previous season, and <em>Juan Perez</em> stunned the baseball world with his 18 wins as a rookie.  With more talented rookies joining the club this year and solid veteran players the organization is predicting our first winning season in just our second year of existance.</p>

      <p>Ever since the Reilly McDonald incident that killed Major League hockey across North America, millions of people have been looking for a way to release their frustrations.  Then one such tychoon, Paul Harvey, came up with the Ontario Baseball League.  Now with 30 teams across the league, competative baseball has not been better.  No more killings, steroids and human torture on the fields this league promotes good old fashioned baseball.  So put down your axes, and barbed wire hockey sticks and visit Canada's new past time.  Baseball.</p>
